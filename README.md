# TextAdventure

I am attempting to create a text adventure game shell, where levels will be added using a JSON file (hoping to make a db instead later). All modules are going to be standard with python

creating a blocks class which will hold the grid squares for the game
creating a player class, this will hold all player information

for the enemy they will have an attack/health value, when attacking damage will happen at the same time, after each turn the player will have the option to run if they think they will not beat the monster

The shield will be a number from 0-100 it will take that much of a percentage off of the hit to HP, and lower buy a number will work out a formula depending on attack powr
